# odin-recipes
Here is my first project for the curriculum of theodinproject.com/HTLM Foundations.

It is my first ever three-web-page website with links and buttons.

I was training to make unordered and ordered lists on the recipes material, incert pictures and add some simple CSS styling to the website appearence.

I really enjoyed the process of writing it. 
Hope, you will enjoy the outcome!
