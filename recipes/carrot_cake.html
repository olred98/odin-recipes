    <h1>Carrot Cake</h1> 
    <h3>Finding a really good carrot cake is hit or miss. They are either too dry, contain too much fruit, not enough flavour or go overboard with spices. One bite is all it takes for you to be hooked on this one. This is The One. Hands down the best Carrot Cake you will ever have in your life!</h3>

    <h2>How to make carrot cake from scratch?</h2>
    <p><strong>Dry ingredients</strong> are combined together first.</p>
    <p><strong>Wet ingredients</strong> are whisked together next along with sugar.</p>
    <p><strong>Combine both</strong> until the batter is smooth.</p>
    <p><strong>Fold</strong> in grated carrots, nuts and sultanas. We love pecans but you can use walnuts, cashews, almonds or peanuts.</p>
    <p>You’ll need two 9-inch round cake pans to create your layers, then bake for 40-45 minutes.</p>
    <h2>How to make moist carrot cake?</h2>
    <p>The texture in this carrot cake is unbelievable. Yes, it’s fluffy and light as mentioned above, but its moist texture is unforgettable. Three main ingredients help make this carrot cake super moist:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil (or canola oil can be used)</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Fruit puree: Crushed pineapple or applesauce. We chose the pineapple option after trying it with applesauce and found blending crushed pineapple for a couple of seconds in a magic bullet or blender yielded the best results. You can also leave the fruit out and substitute with melted butter. You can’t taste the fruit in this at all.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to know when it is ready?</h2>
    <p>Insert a toothpick or a wooden skewer into the centre of each carrot cake. It should come out clean. Let the cakes cool completely before frosting. If the cakes have a little warmth in the centres, the frosting will become runny while you spread it on!</p>
